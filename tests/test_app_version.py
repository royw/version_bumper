This is a sanity check to make sure versions are working as expected.
Yes, we have two definitive sources of version, both in pyproject.toml,
one for poetry (tool.poetry.version), and one for everyone else
(project.version).
Then for our project, we extract the version from the metadata, which
should have been generated from the current pyproject.toml file.
Thus, let's be sure this pythonisque SNAFU is actually working...
